Balance between:
	1. Supplies income and spenditure
	2. Upgrades and soldier outupt
	3. Passive camps and artillery
		3a. Within passive camps, defensive and supplies

Strategic rambling:
	SHIELDS:
	-They are only situationally useful (if suffering significant artillery damage)
	therefore, we should code for this to determine if we are at risk of taking 
	serious artillery damage
	-A potential strategy may be an artillery feint to get them to build shields
	MEDBAYS:
	-Slow heal rate, tests need to be run on their effectiveness
	SUPPLIERS:
	-Power permitting, 1-2 suppliers are desired as we get the most gain per
	supplier.
	-No more than 6 suppliers should be gotten, as returns start diminishing
	faster
	ARTILLERY:
	-A central artillery can cover the majority of the map, making them 
	potentially useful, most damaging to heavily protected areas (camps, HQ)
	-However, Artillery does 40 Damage/20 turns, while Soldiers do 6 damage / 1 turn
	not to mention that the artilery splash damage is half its normal damage, 
	AND it hurts allied units. 
	-Note should be taken every time an enemy artillery cannon goes off;
	This will allow our units to scatter, hide, or hug enemy units when the 
	enemy artillery is armed next.
	GENERATOR:
	-One generator supplies 1/4 the power of an HQ, quite significant.
	-I will add a list of potential strategies for resource managment later.
	It is  a VERY signficant topic that demands a large section all its own.
